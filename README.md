# Find_Python_Virtual_Environment_and_Activate

## This script does what its name suggests, it searches withing the current working directory any present Python Virtual Environment and when it finds it, it activates it so you can run commands or install Python modules inside that environment.



## AI Involvement

The script's development did not depend on AI tools like ChatGPT, their main use was for creating code comments and descriptions.
