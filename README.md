# Find Python Virtual Environment and Activate

* This script does what its name suggests, it runs as Admin and it searches within the Current Working Directory and its sub-directories for any present Python Virtual Environment and when it finds one it first cleans it of broken packages, then it activates it, so you can then run commands or install Python libraries inside that environment.
* The script also upgrades pip to the latest version inside the Virtual Environment.

This Python script has been compiled as a executable file and works on Windows operating systems.
* There is a compiled 'Find_Python_Virtual_Env_and_Activate.exe' file you can copy and run it into the directory you need to detect and activate the Python Virtual Environment from.
