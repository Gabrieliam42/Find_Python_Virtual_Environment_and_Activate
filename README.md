# Find Python Virtual Environment and Activate

* This script does what its name suggests, it searches within the Current Working Directory for any present Python Virtual Environment and when it finds one, it activates it, so you can then run commands or install Python libraries inside that environment.

This Python script has been compiled as a executable file and works on Windows operating systems.
* There is a compiled 'Find_Python_Virtual_Env_and_Activate.exe' file you can copy and run it into the directory you need to detect and activate the Python Virtual Environment from.
